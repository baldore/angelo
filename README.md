- [ ] Have a list of videos that can be useful for each song.
- [ ] Control those videos with stuff like loops and pinch change.
- [ ] Rating system or favorites.
- [ ] Preview on hover.
- [ ] Chords! very important to be able to study.
- [ ] Labels to find easy stuff (check video about KBD trees... maybe can be useful for the filter)
